# Drug Consumption Data Analysis

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about the drug consumption of over 1,000 human subjects. The participants were asked to rate their use of 18 different drugs, both legal and illegal, on a scale ranging from "never used" to "used in the last day". The dataset includes corresponding names of the attributes, making it easier to understand and analyze the data.

A short description of the ratings of drug usage is available in a separate document, which can be found here: [link to the description document]
Data Exploration

The purpose of this dataset is to understand people's drug usage behaviors and patterns. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the prevalence and frequency of drug consumption among the participants.

The dataset includes self-reported drug usage information provided by the respondents. It captures qualitative data, as each drug is ranked on a scale from "never used" to "used in the last day". Additionally, demographic information of the participants, such as age, gender, and educational attainment, may also be included in the dataset, providing quantitative data for further analysis.
Missing Data Handling

Before conducting any analysis, it is important to handle missing data appropriately. Missing data may exist in the dataset, and appropriate procedures, such as imputation or deletion of incomplete records, should be applied to ensure the integrity of the analysis.
# Usage

To use this dataset for analysis or modeling, follow these steps:

    Download the dataset from the provided link.

    Review the description of the ratings of drug usage to understand the scale and meaning of the ratings.

    Handle any missing data in the dataset using appropriate techniques.

    Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the drug consumption patterns among the participants. This may include examining the prevalence of drug usage, identifying correlations between drug usage and demographic factors, and exploring trends in drug consumption over time.

    Preprocess the data, including any necessary data transformations, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

    Conduct in-depth analysis to understand the relationships between different drugs, identify patterns of drug usage, and uncover any significant findings.

    Visualize the data using appropriate charts, graphs, or other visualizations to effectively communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

    Use the insights gained from the analysis to inform public health strategies, develop targeted interventions, or support further research in the field of drug consumption.

# Conclusion

The drug consumption dataset provides valuable information about the self-reported drug usage of human subjects. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into drug usage behaviors, patterns, and correlations with demographic factors. It is important to handle any missing data appropriately and preprocess the data before conducting analysis or modeling.
